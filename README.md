## 🎓 Learning Journey

### Current Focus Areas (Mid-2025):
- **Penetration Testing** - Working through methodologies and practical applications
- **Network Security** - Deep diving into protocol analysis and network vulnerabilities  
- **Linux Skills** - Mastering Arch Linux administration and security tools
- **Rust Development** - Building CLI security tools and understanding memory safety
- **CTF Challenges** - Participating in beginner-friendly competitions

### Milestones Reached:
- ✅ Progressed through multiple TryHackMe learning paths
- ✅ Built several Rust CLI tools for security tasks
- ✅ Comfortable with basic penetration testing methodology
- ✅ Can navigate and troubleshoot Arch Linux confidently
- ✅ Still successfully avoiding Python (except when teachers demand it!)

---

## 🔧 My Current Setup (June 2025)

- **OS**: Arch Linux (btw I use Arch) - Breaks Too Frequenty .....
- **Main Language**: Rust 🦀 - Getting more proficient every day
- **Editor**: VS Code with extensive Rust tooling
- **Learning Platforms**: TryHackMe, HackTheBox (starter level), YouTube
- **VM**: Kali Linux for security testing and CTF practice
- **Hardware**: Whatever laptop can handle VMs and doesn't crash

---

## 🎯 Goals for Rest of 2025

- [ ] Complete advanced TryHackMe learning paths
- [ ] Contribute to open-source security tools in Rust
- [ ] Participate in my first real CTF competition
- [ ] Learn more about malware analysis and reverse engineering
- [ ] Get comfortable with more advanced penetration testing techniques
- [ ] Survive final year of high school while maintaining learning momentum

---

## 💭 Mid-2025 Reality Check

```rust
// Being honest about progress after months of learning
fn current_skill_level() -> &'static str {
    match months_of_learning {
        0..=3 => "Complete noob but enthusiastic!",
        3..=6 => "Starting to understand the basics",
        6..=12 => "Can follow tutorials and solve easy challenges", // <- I'm here
        12..=24 => "Actually getting decent at this stuff",
        _ => "Probably overestimating my abilities as usual"
    }
}

// After several months: definitely more confident but still lots to learn!
```

## 💡 Currently Reading/Watching (June 2025)

- 📖 "The Web Application Hacker's Handbook" - Making actual progress now!
- 🎥 IppSec walkthroughs for retired HackTheBox machines
- 📚 Advanced TryHackMe rooms and learning paths
- 🔍 Security blogs, CVE analyses, and research papers
- 🦀 The Rust Book (again) - for better tool development

---

## ⚡ Fun Facts (Updated June 2025)

- 🎂 Still 17 but feeling way more confident about cybersecurity
- 🦀 Rust skills have improved significantly - can build useful tools now!
- 🐧 Arch Linux power user (it breaks every week!)
- 🔐 TryHackMe streak going strong - addicted to learning
- 🐍 Python tolerance slightly increased (still prefer Rust though)
- ☕ Coffee consumption directly correlates with CTF difficulty
- 🎮 CTFs are basically the best puzzle games ever invented
- 📈 Actually starting to feel like I know what I'm doing (sometimes)
